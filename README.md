`unmarked` is an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package for analyzing ecological data arising from several popular sampling techniques.  The sampling methods include point counts, occurrence sampling, distance sampling, removal, double observer, and many others. `unmarked` uses hierarchical models to incorporate covariates of the latent abundance (or occupancy) and imperfect detection processes.
