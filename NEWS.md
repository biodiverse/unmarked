# unmarked 0.13-0

# unmarked 0.12-3

* New 'occuMulti' function added by Ken Kellner

# unmarked 0.12-0

* Fixed mistake in turnover calculations in colext vignette (thanks to Giacomo Tavecchia) 
* added pcount.spHDS from AHM book. 
* updated predict method for pcount to include ZIP model
* Adam Smith added some parallel capabilities to the parboot functionality
* Adam Smith fixed formatMult conversion of julian date to factor
* Auriel Fournier fixed formatDistData to pad data with NA
* fixed error in obsToY for custom pi function

# unmarked 0.11-0

* Andy Royle is the new maintainer  
* Added Rebecca Hutchinson's penalized likelihood function occuPEN (experimental) 
* fixed bug in gmultmix to accommodate mixed sampling protocols (NA in count frequency vector is not counted in the constraint that multinomial cell probabilities sum to 1)  
* Changed variable 'ufp' to 'ufc' in ovenbird data and related functions.
* Removed constraint in pcountOpen that lambdaformula==omegaformula 
* Fixed bug in gdistsamp that caused error when NAs were present in half-normal model  
* Fixed bug in ranef (it was giving an error message for pcountOpen with the new dynamics options (Ricker and Gompertz) and working incorrectly for pcountOpen with immigration)
* Fixed bug in pcountOpen that occurred when covariates were time varying but not varying among sites 

# unmarked 0.10-6

* Fixed bug in C++ code that was causing problems on Solaris 

# unmarked 0.10-5

* Added new models of population dynamics to pcountOpen. Most changes contributed by Jeff Hostetler.  

# unmarked 0.10-4

* Added importFrom("plyr", "ldply") to NAMESPACE because "reshape" no longer depends on "plyr"

# unmarked 0.10-3

* RcppArmadillo was moved from "Depends" section of DESCRIPTION file to "LinkingTo"

# unmarked 0.10-2

* Thanks for Dirk Eddelbuettel for patch to deal with change in Armadillo's in-place reshape function. Serious problems might occur if you use a recent version of RcppArmadillo and an old version of unmarked.
* Dave Miller added another NA handling fix in occuFP(). I forgot to add this one in the previous version.

# unmarked 0.10-1

* Doc fixes requested by CRAN

# unmarked 0.10-0

* Fixed NA handling in occuFP()
* Fixed integration setting in C++ code that were causing segfaults when calling distsamp
* Replace raster:::layerNames() with raster:::names()
* distsamp() and gdistsamp() should be faster and more stable for some keyfun/survey combinations
